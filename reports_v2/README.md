# reports_v2

This directory stores governance and validated run metadata for the remediation track.

Rules:
- Do not write legacy journal artifacts here.
- Register every pilot/full run in `run_registry.csv`.
- Store audits and manifests under `reports_v2/audits/` and `reports_v2/manifests/`.
- GPU runs are forbidden until Gate 1 re-audit is PASS.
