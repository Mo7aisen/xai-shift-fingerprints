# Hardshift Project Final Verification

- Date: `2026-02-28`
- Verification scope: manuscript rescoping, governance closure, final freeze, submission bundle assembly
- Verification status: `PASS`
- Submission status: `READY_FOR_SCOPED_ASSEMBLY`

## Scope Verified

### Manuscript scope

- Phase 1 Extended retained as the sole primary, claim-carrying contribution: `PASS`
- Hardshift extension demoted to attempted extension / limitations: `PASS`
- Journal submission skeleton updated to reflect the new scope: `PASS`

### Governance closure

- `gamma085` failure documentation present: `PASS`
- `jpeg90` failure documentation present: `PASS`
- v0.2 final outcome documented as `0/2 survivors`: `PASS`
- project final status documented as `CLOSED`: `PASS`

### Freeze and traceability

- Final freeze checksum manifest created: `PASS`
- Submission bundle index created: `PASS`
- Reviewer-traceable audit trail preserved for both failed P2 runs: `PASS`

## Key Outcome

The hardshift branch is closed with `0/2` surviving candidates under v0.2 governance. The current fingerprint method failed in the Shenzhen hardshift setting under unchanged Gate-3 criteria. This is recorded as an honest negative result.

Phase 1 Extended remains validated and is the correct primary basis for the final manuscript package.

## Readiness Interpretation

`READY_FOR_SCOPED_ASSEMBLY` means:

- the package is ready to assemble for reviewer-facing submission with Phase 1 Extended as the primary evidence base,
- the hardshift branch is fully documented as a negative extension,
- the governance trail is preserved and auditable,
- but final prose polishing and claim wording should still remain aligned to the narrower validated scope.
