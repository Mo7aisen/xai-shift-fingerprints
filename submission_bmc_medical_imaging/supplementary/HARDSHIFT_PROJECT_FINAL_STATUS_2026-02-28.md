# Hardshift Project Final Status

- Date: `2026-02-28`
- Project branch: Shenzhen hardshift extension (`P1.5 -> P2`)
- Final branch status: `CLOSED`
- Final outcome: `0/2 survivors under v0.2 governance`

## Final Disposition

The hardshift extension branch is closed.

Under the predeclared v0.2 governance path, both promoted candidates failed P2 Gate-3 validation:

- `shenzhen_to_shenzhen_pp_gamma085`: `FAIL`
- `shenzhen_to_shenzhen_pp_jpeg90`: `FAIL`

No candidate survived to P3, so no P3 launch is authorized. The branch should be retained as an honest negative result that defines a current limitation of the fingerprint method in the Shenzhen hardshift setting.

## Validated Contribution That Remains in Scope

Phase 1 Extended remains the validated, claim-carrying contribution for the final manuscript package. It should be presented as the primary evidence base.

The hardshift extension should remain in scope only as:

- a reviewer-traceable attempted extension,
- a negative result under frozen governance,
- a limitations statement that constrains the method's supported claim scope.

## Governance Closure

- v0.2 candidate path: `closed`
- Survivors: `0/2`
- Post-hoc threshold changes: `not permitted`
- P3 hardshift launch: `not permitted`
- Recommended branch decision: `halt and report honestly`

## Final Manuscript Scope

- Primary contribution: Phase 1 Extended
- Secondary material: hardshift extension as attempted but failed
- Discussion requirement: explicitly state the hardshift failure as a method limitation in the Shenzhen setting
